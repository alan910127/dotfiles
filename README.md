# Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repository!
This collection contains my personalized configuration files for various development environments‚Äîcrafted for speed, clarity, and comfort.

## üöÄ Installation

You can set up everything with a single command:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alan910127/dotfiles/refs/heads/main/bootstrap | bash
```

Alternatively, if curl isn't available:

```sh
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alan910127/dotfiles/refs/heads/main/bootstrap | bash
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This script will symlink configuration files and install essential tools.
> Make sure to review the script before running it if you're cautious (which you should be!).

## üìÅ What's Included?

- Zsh configuration (.zshrc, plugins, themes)
- Neovim setup
- Git configuration
- Tmux layout
- Other CLI tools and aliases

## üß™ Dry Run Preview

Curious what the script will do? You can run it with `--dry` to preview the steps without making any changes:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alan910127/dotfiles/refs/heads/main/bootstrap | bash -s - --dry
```

Example output:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveat

This setup is primarily developed and tested on **Arch Linux**.  
Basic support for **Ubuntu** is included, but it may be incomplete (e.g., missing package names or dependencies).
